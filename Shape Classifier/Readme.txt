This is a web-based deep learning model that uses a sequential architecture, linear neural networks (LNN), and an image shape detector.

I'm aiming to keep everything within JavaScript to enable faster deployment.

Since my primary goal is learning, I found that basic concepts are easier to model and run using TensorFlow.js. 
Additionally, most of the structure is quite similar to Python libraries, which makes the transition smoother.
